A small script to generate coverage badges using Coverage.py. Example of a generated badge:

The badge template has been taken from shields.io_, therefore it should look
mostly good. (The spec is a bit stricter on the margins, but I can't easily do
text width calculations in Python so the margins might not always be 4px.)

Installation
------------
Run:

.. code-block::
    
    pip install coverage-badge


Usage
-----

First, run Coverage.py to generate the necessary coverage data. Then you can
either return the badge SVG to stdout::

    $ coverage-badge

...or write it to a file::

    $ coverage-badge -o coverage.svg

It's important that you run ``coverage-badge`` from the directory where the
``.coverage`` data file is located.

Different colors for cover ranges:
